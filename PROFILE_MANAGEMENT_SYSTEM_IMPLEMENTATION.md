# Profile Management & Flagging System Implementation

## Overview

The Profile Management & Flagging System is a comprehensive admin tool built for the Bell Registry admin portal that allows administrators to review, moderate, and manage user profiles across the platform. This system implements an auto-approval approach with optional moderation capabilities, rather than a mandatory pending review queue.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Management Dashboard (`/profiles`)
- **Comprehensive Profile Listing**: View all professional profiles with key information
- **Advanced Filtering & Search**: 
  - Filter by status (Approved, Pending, Rejected, Suspended)
  - Search by name or email
  - Filter profiles with reports
  - Filter by "Open to Work" status
  - Sort by newest, oldest, most viewed, most reported
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple profiles and perform batch operations
- **Individual Quick Actions**: Approve, suspend, or flag profiles directly from the list
- **Real-time Profile Statistics**: View profile views, report counts, and status badges

### 2. Detailed Profile Review (`/profiles/[id]`)
- **Comprehensive Profile View**: Complete user profile information including:
  - Basic information (name, email, phone, profile image)
  - Professional details (bio, preferred role, skills, experience)
  - Work preferences (salary range, location preferences, work types)
  - Account statistics (profile views, member since, last login)
- **Admin Actions**: Approve, suspend, reject, or flag profiles
- **Public Profile Access**: Direct link to view the user's public profile
- **Contact Information**: Full contact details for admin reference

### 3. Profile Actions & Moderation
- **Approve**: Mark profiles as approved and in good standing
- **Suspend**: Temporarily suspend profile access (planned feature)
- **Flag**: Mark profiles for further review or investigation
- **Reject**: Mark profiles as rejected (planned feature)
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions are logged for accountability

### 4. Reporting Integration
- **Report Counting**: Track number of reports per profile
- **Report Status Badges**: Visual indicators for profiles with reports
- **Report Review**: Quick access to view reports for flagged profiles

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

Added new models to support the profile management system:

```prisma
model ProfileReport {
  id           String              @id @default(cuid())
  reportedUserId String
  reporterUserId String?
  reason       String
  details      String?
  status       ProfileReportStatus @default(PENDING)
  reviewedAt   DateTime?
  reviewedBy   String?
  createdAt    DateTime            @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime            @updatedAt
  reportedUser User                @relation("ReportedUser")
  reporterUser User?               @relation("ReporterUser")
  reviewer     User?               @relation("ReviewerUser")
}

enum ProfileReportStatus {
  PENDING
  REVIEWED
  RESOLVED
  DISMISSED
}
```

Added `isSuspended` field to User model for profile suspension functionality.

### API Endpoints

4. **Take Action**: Approve, flag, or suspend based on findings
5. **Follow Up**: Monitor for additional reports

## Current Limitations

### Temporary Implementation Notes
- **Database Migration Pending**: ProfileReport model and status fields require database migration
- **Report Counts**: Currently defaulted to 0 until migration is complete
