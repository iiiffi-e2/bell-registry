## AI Service Implementation

### Core Algorithm
1. **Profile Analysis**: Extracts user's skills, preferences, location, salary expectations
2. **Job Scanning**: Retrieves active job listings (max 50 for performance)
3. **AI Analysis**: Sends structured prompt to GPT-4 for compatibility analysis
4. **Score Generation**: AI provides numerical scores and reasoning
5. **Result Processing**: Validates, filters, and sorts results by score

### OpenAI Configuration
```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  timeout: 30000,
  maxRetries: 3,
});

// Model: GPT-4
// Temperature: 0.3 (consistent, factual responses)
// Max Tokens: 3000 (detailed analysis)
// Token Optimization: Analyzes 20 jobs max, truncated content
```

## User Experience

### Professional Dashboard Integration
The AI Job Matches component appears prominently on the professional dashboard:
- Positioned after profile completion alert and stats
- Before the widgets row for maximum visibility
- Includes refresh button and error handling
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Visual Design
- **Match Scores**: Color-coded badges (green: 80+, yellow: 60-79, red: <60)
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of each matching factor
- **Company Info**: Company name, location, salary (if available)
- **Action Buttons**: "View Job Details" and "Save Job" (encourages users to read full details before applying)

## Performance & Optimization

### Smart Caching Strategy
- **Intelligent Loading**: Checks for cached matches first, avoids unnecessary AI calls on every page load
- **24-Hour Cache Validity**: Cached matches remain fresh for 24 hours to balance accuracy and efficiency
- **Database Storage**: Results stored in JobMatch table to avoid re-computation
- **Manual Refresh**: Users can force refresh when needed or when cache is stale
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows last updated timestamp and suggests refresh when needed
- **Cost Optimization**: Prevents excessive OpenAI API usage on dashboard reloads

### API Endpoints
- **GET `/api/ai/job-matches/cached`**: Returns cached matches without AI processing
- **POST `/api/ai/job-matches`**: Forces new AI analysis and refreshes cache

### Rate Limiting
- OpenAI API has built-in rate limiting
- 20 job limit per analysis for token optimization
- Timeout protection (30 seconds)

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- User data only sent to OpenAI for analysis
