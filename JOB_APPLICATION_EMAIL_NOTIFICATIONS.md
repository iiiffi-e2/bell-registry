# Job Application Email Notifications

## Overview

This system automatically sends email notifications to employers when professionals apply for their job postings. The emails include comprehensive information about the application and direct links to the employer's dashboard.

## Features

- **Automatic Notifications**: Emails are sent immediately when a job application is submitted
- **Resume Attachments**: Direct download links to the candidate's resume
- **Cover Letter Support**: Includes cover letter if provided by the candidate
- **Professional Design**: Beautiful, responsive email template with The Bell Registry branding
- **Action Buttons**: Direct links to view all applications and contact the candidate
- **Development Mode**: Safe testing with Resend's development email addresses

## How It Works

### 1. Application Submission
When a professional applies for a job through the `/api/jobs/apply` endpoint:

1. The application is validated and stored in the database
2. Resume and cover letter files are uploaded to storage
3. The system fetches additional information needed for the email:
   - Job details (title, location)
   - Employer information (name, email, company)
   - Candidate information (name, email)
   - Application details (message, attachments)

### 2. Email Generation
The `sendJobApplicationNotificationEmail` function creates a professional HTML email containing:

- **Header**: The Bell Registry branding and notification title
- **Job Details**: Position, location, and company information
- **Candidate Information**: Applicant name, email, and application date
- **Cover Message**: Any additional message provided by the candidate
- **Documents**: Download links for resume and cover letter (if provided)
- **Action Buttons**: Links to dashboard and direct contact options

### 3. Email Delivery
- Uses Resend email service for reliable delivery
- In development mode, emails are sent to `delivered@resend.dev` for testing
- In production, emails are sent to the actual employer email address
- Comprehensive error handling ensures application submission isn't affected by email failures

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `packages/main-app/src/lib/job-application-email-service.ts` - Main email service

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Required for email delivery
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Used for dashboard links in emails

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Emails sent to `delivered@resend.dev` for testing
- **Production**: Emails sent to actual employer addresses
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Testing

### Test Endpoint
Use the `/api/test-job-application-email` endpoint to test the email service:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-job-application-email
```

This endpoint is only available in development mode for security.

### Test Data
The test endpoint uses sample data to demonstrate:
- All email template sections
- Document attachment handling
- Professional formatting
- Action button functionality

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Email failures don't prevent application submission
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Fallback values for missing information

### Logging
- Application submission success/failure
- Email delivery attempts and results
- Development mode debugging information

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Test endpoints only available in development
- No sensitive information exposed in logs
- Secure file download links

### Data Privacy
- Only necessary information included in emails
- Secure storage of application documents
- Professional communication standards

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Email Templates**: Additional template variations for different job types
2. **Scheduling**: Option to batch notifications or send at specific times
3. **Preferences**: Allow employers to customize notification settings

5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile email experience

### Integration Opportunities
1. **SMS Notifications**: Text message alerts for urgent applications
2. **Slack/Teams**: Integration with workplace communication tools
3. **Calendar Integration**: Schedule follow-up reminders
4. **CRM Integration**: Connect with existing applicant tracking systems

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Monitor email delivery success rates
- Track application submission volumes
- Alert on email service failures

### Performance
- Email sending doesn't block application processing
- Asynchronous email delivery for better user experience
- Efficient database queries for required information

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Email Not Sending**: Check RESEND_API_KEY configuration
2. **Missing Information**: Verify database relationships and data integrity
3. **Template Issues**: Check HTML formatting and variable substitution

### Debugging
- Comprehensive console logging in development mode
- Test endpoint for isolated email testing
- Error details included in API responses
