# Membership Access Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a membership access tracking system to the Bell Registry platform, allowing administrators to see how professionals gained access to the platform during the registration process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`packages/shared/src/database/schema.prisma`)

#### New Enum Type
```prisma
enum MembershipAccessType {
  BELL_REGISTRY_REFERRAL
  PROFESSIONAL_REFERRAL
  NEW_APPLICANT
}
```

#### New User Fields
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields ...
  membershipAccess         MembershipAccessType @default(NEW_APPLICANT)
  referralProfessionalName String?
  // ... existing fields ...
}
```
