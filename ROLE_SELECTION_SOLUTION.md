# Role Selection Solution for "Get Started" Button

## Problem
The home page had multiple "Get Started" buttons that didn't properly identify whether users were professionals, employers, or agencies, leading to unclear user routing.

## Solution Implemented
I implemented a **Role Selection Modal** approach that provides a clean, user-friendly way to identify user types before proceeding to registration.

### Key Components Created

#### 1. Role Selection Modal (`src/components/modals/role-selection-modal.tsx`)
- Beautiful modal with three clear role options:
  - **Professional**: For job seekers looking for employment
  - **Employer**: For direct employers hiring staff
  - **Agency**: For staffing agencies representing employers
- Each role card includes:
  - Descriptive title and explanation
  - Icon for visual clarity
  - List of benefits/features for that role type
  - Direct routing to appropriate registration flow

#### 2. Updated Home Page Client Component (`src/components/home-page-client.tsx`)
- Converted the home page to use client-side state management
- Replaced direct "Get Started" links with modal triggers
- Maintains all existing content and styling
- Integrated the role selection modal

#### 3. Enhanced Registration Form (`src/components/auth/register-form.tsx`)
- Added support for `?role=agency` URL parameter
- Updated role detection logic to handle all three user types
- Enhanced role selection UI for employer/agency differentiation

### User Flow
1. User clicks any "Get Started" button on the home page
2. Role selection modal appears with three clear options
3. User selects their role (Professional, Employer, or Agency)
4. Modal closes and routes user to appropriate registration form:
   - Professional → `/register?role=candidate`
   - Employer → `/register?role=employer`
   - Agency → `/register?role=agency`
5. Registration form adapts based on the role parameter

### Benefits
- **Clear User Intent**: Users explicitly choose their role before proceeding
- **Better UX**: No confusion about which registration path to take
- **Agency Support**: Proper support for agencies (previously missing)
- **Consistent Routing**: All "Get Started" buttons now follow the same flow
- **Visual Appeal**: Modern modal design with icons and benefit lists
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design that works on all devices

### Technical Details
- Uses Headless UI for accessible modal components
- Heroicons for consistent iconography
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Next.js App Router compatible
- TypeScript for type safety

## Files Modified
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated to use client component
- `src/components/auth/register-form.tsx` - Added agency role support
- `src/components/modals/role-selection-modal.tsx` - New modal component
- `src/components/home-page-client.tsx` - New client component for home page

## Testing
The solution can be tested by:
1. Running `npm run dev`
2. Navigating to the home page
3. Clicking any "Get Started" button
4. Verifying the modal appears with three role options
5. Testing each role selection routes to the correct registration form
